### First Interviewee: Female 34 years old.

 The presentation was informative and had a nice information flow starting from the problem statement, definition of terms, and concluding with recommendations. I particularly liked the artistic choice of pictures and supporting graphs which I believe greatly complimented the idea.

The visuals were very eye catching and supported the key points.

5. Was the length of the presentation appropriate?

6. Did the presenter address any questions or concerns you had about the topic?
Yes. Which was regarding the psychological aspects of social media. 

7. Was the overall message of the presentation clear and compelling?
Yes. The overall message of the presentation was clear and compelling. The presentation effectively communicated the main points and made a persuasive argument. A clear and compelling message can help to ensure that the audience takes away something valuable from the presentation.

8. Was there anything that could have been improved in the presentation?
Ways to improve the presentation by adding more statistics or numbers. This can help to add credibility to the argument and reinforce the main points. Using statistics and numbers can also help to make the presentation more persuasive and engaging.

### Second Interviewee: Male 38 

1.	What did you like about the presentation?
What I liked about the presentation was the way it was shown. It was different from traditional PowerPoint presentations, which made it more visually appealing and engaging. I appreciate the effort to make the presentation stand out and not follow the usual template.

2.	Were the key points of the presentation clear and well-organized?
In my opinion, the main key point was clear, but there was a lack of flow in the presentation. The information presented seemed to jump from one point to another without a clear transition. This made it harder to follow and understand the main message.

3.	Was the presentation engaging and did it hold your attention?
At the beginning of the presentation, I found the topic very interesting, and it held my attention. However, towards the middle and towards the end, I lost interest. The presentation became less engaging and less informative as it progressed.

4.	Were the visuals used effectively to support the key points?
I thought the visuals used were effective in supporting the key points, but it was not clear if they were free sources or copyrighted. It would be helpful to include information about the sources used in the presentation to avoid any legal issues.

5.	Was the length of the presentation appropriate?
The length of the presentation was appropriate, but I found it to be very short. It would have been helpful to have more time to dive deeper into the topic and provide more information.

6.	Did the presenter address any questions or concerns you had about the topic?
The presentation did not address some of my questions and concerns about the topic. For example, I was unclear about what the information was based on and how severe the issue was. It would have been helpful to have more context and data to understand the topic better.

7.	Was the overall message of the presentation clear and compelling?
Despite some of the issues, the overall message of the presentation was clear and compelling. 

8.	Was there anything that could have been improved in the presentation?
To improve the presentation, it would have been helpful to add sources and include more data to support the main points. It would have been useful to use information that reflected on the population and targeted audience. This would have made the presentation more credible and relevant to the audience.


### Third Interviewee: female adolecent 15 years 

1.	What did you like about the presentation?
As a 15-year-old girl, I particularly liked the pictures used in the presentation. The images were eye-catching and helped to make the presentation more visually appealing. They also helped me to understand the main points better, and made the presentation more engaging.

2.	Were the key points of the presentation clear and well-organized?
The key points of the presentation were clear and well-organized. However, I did not see it as a huge problem, and I was not particularly concerned about the issue being presented. Nonetheless, I was able to understand the key points of the presentation, and they were presented in a logical order.

3.	Was the presentation engaging and did it hold your attention?
The presentation was engaging, but it was a little boring for me. As a teenager, I prefer presentations that are more interactive and that use a variety of media to keep my attention. While the presentation was informative, it did not hold my attention as much as I would have liked.

4.	Were the visuals used effectively to support the key points?
The visuals used in the presentation were effective in supporting the key points. As a teenager, I respond well to visuals, and I found that the pictures and graphs used in the presentation helped me to understand the main points better. They also added interest to the presentation.

5.	Was the length of the presentation appropriate?
As a teenager, I found the presentation to be long. My attention span is shorter than that of an adult, and I would have preferred a shorter presentation that was more to the point. Nonetheless, I was able to sit through the entire presentation and understand the main points.

6.	Did the presenter address any questions or concerns you had about the topic?
I still could not understand how the issue presented in the presentation would affect how I look to myself. This is an important concern for teenagers, and I would have liked to see more information presented on this topic. If the presenter had addressed this concern, I would have felt more engaged with the presentation.


7.	Was the overall message of the presentation clear and compelling?
As a 15-year-old girl, I found the overall message of the presentation to be clear and compelling. The presenter made a good case for the importance of the issue being presented, and I was able to understand the main points.

8.	Was there anything that could have been improved in the presentation?
To improve the presentation, I would suggest making it more relevant to people my age. The presentation should use language that is easy for teenagers to understand, and it should include more graphics that are easy to interpret. Additionally, I would suggest telling a story that is relevant to teenagers and that they can relate to. This will help to make the presentation more engaging and more effective in communicating the main points.


# Interview findings

Based on the feedback provided, it appears that the presentation was effective in conveying its message, but there are some areas for improvement. The fact that the interviewees had varying interpretations of the presentation suggests that there may be inconsistencies in the way the information was presented or received by different audience members.

The feedback indicates that the presentation had clear key points, but improvements in the flow of information, use of statistics, cite all information used, and engagement for younger audiences could be made. Improving the flow of information could involve reorganizing the content in a more logical and structured way, while using statistics more effectively could involve providing context or visual aids to help illustrate key points.

To engage younger audiences, the use of more interactive and visually engaging materials such as videos, animations, or gamification may be necessary. Overall, the presentation was effective in conveying its message, but there is still room for improvement to make it more engaging and accessible to a wider range of audiences.
