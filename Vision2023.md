# My role in the 2030 Suadi vision!
## Iâ€™m passionate about serving the community. I carry the desire to give back to my community, where I learned my baby steps. My journey in the United States has taught me many valuable lessons, but the most important one is to always believe in oneself. I believe that I can create an unforgettable impact, and I want this impact to be where I belong. I want to change the unchangeable, and I want to be the best role model to young Saudi girls. The 2030 Saudi vision has been empowering Saudi women to take their roles in supporting the country's development. I will never let any opportunity I have to be a pivotal part of realizing the vision of 2030. I acquired my passion for helping others when I was completing my capstone project before finishing my undergraduate studies. I have encountered many in need, where they lack basics for humanity. I wanted to change the world, I wanted to ensure each human being their dignity. The world is a cruel place. Yet, as humankind, we can do better.
