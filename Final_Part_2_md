## User research and interviews
### You should have also developed a simple user research protocol that describes what you hope to find during your user interviews, including your research questions and the script.  Once your interviews are complete, you should have documented findings that detail what you've learned by showing your early wireframes / storyboards to at least three different individuals.  
Your user research protocol should clearly identify the following: 
a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story; 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview; 
c. your interview script; 
d. the findings from your interviews; and 
e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
When talking about your findings, specific insights and observations, key quotes and other insights are better than broad, sweeping generalizations.  Look across your interviews and note where you have consistent feedback vs. any observations that might be conflicting.  Talk about how you plan on using this feedback to improve your project as you head into Part III.
